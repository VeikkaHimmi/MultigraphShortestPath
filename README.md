# Multigraph
Project idea is to find the most liquid path from one currency to another, by taking in account the orderbook ask and bid orders. To do this we will build multigraph out of currecies, where nodes are presented as a currency and edges are created from orderbook asks and bids. 

For now I'll use tradingpairs provided by Coinbase.
